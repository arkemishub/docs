# Arke Hex Local development

## Overview

Clone the repo you want:
  - [arke](https://github.com/arkemishub/arke)
  - [arke_postgres](https://github.com/arkemishub/arke-postgres)
  - [arke_auth](https://github.com/arkemishub/arke-auth)
  - [arke_server](https://github.com/arkemishub/arke-server)

Add to your `.env` file the path of the cloned package:

```bash
export EX_DEP_${REPO_NAME}_PATH="PATH_TO_CLONED_REPO"

example EX_DEP_ARKE_POSTGRES_PATH="/path/to/arke_postgres/folder"
```

Run the [commands](#start-the-server) in the linked section. If you have previously installed the dependencies use the `clean` commands before install the deps again. (Use the `clean` also if you do not see your changes locally)

By adding the `EX_DEP_{REPO_NAME}_PATH` variable you are able to use the arke's packages cloned locally.
