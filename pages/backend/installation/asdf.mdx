# asdf version manager and Elixir
We provide our standard installation, if you need other configuration follow the [official documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/).

### Install asdf
Clone the official github repo on your root:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf
```

Add the following to `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"
```

Open a new terminal tab or confirm `~/.zshrc` edit with:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Check the correct installation:
```bash
asdf --version
v0.14.0
```

### Install Erlang and Elixir
Currently the Arke packages are tested with the below Erlang and Elixir versions, so we suggest to install them:
```bash
erlang
 *25.3.2.3
elixir
 *1.14.5-otp-25
```

#### Install Erlang

To start, we need to install the asdf plugin that installs Erlang and manages the versions for us.

<Callout type="warning">
 Before installing Erlang, make sure you follow the directions on the plugin page for your platform. To get the best
 experience, there are additional OS dependencies that should be installed. Once the dependencies are installed,
 you are ready to install Erlang.
</Callout>

The following command adds the Erlang plugin.
```bash
asdf plugin-add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git
```

To install Erlang, you first need to decide which version you need. If you donâ€™t have any specific project needs,
you can select the suggested 25.3.2.3 version or the latest. To list the available versions, use the asdf list-all erlang command.

```bash
(suggested)
asdf install erlang 25.3.2.3
(latest)
asdf install erlang 26.2.2
...
```

When Erlang version has been installed. Activate globally and locally with:
```bash
asdf global erlang 26.2.2
asdf local erlang 26.2.2
```

#### Install Elixir
We need to install the asdf plugin that installs Elixir and manages the versions for us.

The following command adds the Elixir plugin.
```bash
asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
```

Now you need to decide which version of Elixir to install. Again, unless you have specific project needs, go with the
suggested 1.14.5-otp-25 or latest version. To get a list of available versions, use the asdf list-all elixir command.

```bash
(suggested)
asdf install elixir 1.14.5-otp-25
(latest)
asdf install elixir 1.16.1
...
```

When Elixir version has been installed. Activate globally and locally with:
```bash
asdf global erlang 26.2.2
asdf local erlang 26.2.2
```

Check that all installation goes well with:
```
elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.2.2.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1]

Elixir 1.14.5 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)
```
