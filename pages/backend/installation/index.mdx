# Installation
To start the backend development there are System Requirements:
- Erlang 25.3.2.3
- Elixir 1.14.5-otp-25 or later

<Callout type="info">
  We suggest to install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage different erlang and elixir versions. [Here](/backend/installation/asdf) you can find
  a quick guide to install it.
</Callout>

To start with backend development we need to initialize the [Phoenix Starter](/docs/think-arke/architecture/backend#phoenix-starter).

## CLI Installation
We recommend starting a new Arke Backend app using `arkectl create-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

<Callout type="info">
  if you have not installed our command line tool yet follow the [guide](/docs/arkectl)
