# Introduction

Welcome to the Arke documentation!

## What is Arke?

Arke is a All-in-one framework for building full-stack web applications.
You use can use React/Next.js with Arke.js packages to build user interfaces on frontend, and Elixir with Arke Hex packages
for create a complete backend solution with authentication, autogenerated Rest API, and a lot of more.

Arke is born to helps developers to create complex applications faster by automatically hiding and managing the "behind the scenes" of work.
This allows you to focus on building your solutions instead of spending time on repetitive functionality as CRUD, Apis.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Arke can help you build fast solutions.

### How to Use These Docs
On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, checkout the Installation guide.

### Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Arke functionality.
We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a intermediate understanding of React and Next.js for the frontend part and Elixir for Backend.
