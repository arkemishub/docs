# Approach and method
Arke was studied to avoid code and logic repetition. What you will find here is a standardized approach, this permits
to unify logics with naming and methods.

Getting into the arke mindset you'll discover that architecture shared a common philosophy. Variable naming and conventions
are the main keys. We invite you to follow the below terminology to get started with Arke development, this help you to
understand the how data are stored and how should be modeled.

### Arke
It's a type of abstract model that can represent a person, a place or a thing. An Arke can be imagined as a json
representation of a database table, the name of which will be determined by the name of the Arke itself.

Everything could be described as an Arke, as a digital twin for our scopes.
Imagine that you want to create an application to manage customers, projects and leads.
You will create an Arke for each entity that you want to manage: e.g. the arke `customer`, the arke `project` and the arke `lead`
(Use as convention the singular for the identifier naming)

Every time that you'll create the arke `primitive` a set of functionalities are attached: as Database storing (persistance),
the autogenerated APIs (with permissions, sorting, filters and more), the topology relations system ad more.

### Parameters

Each arke has a list of `default` assigned parameters and a `custom` list. The parameters extends the attributes of our entity to describe it.
Considering the arke `customer` for our application, we can associate parameters name/email/phone_number/etc. to describe, and
later collect, the customers data.

<Callout type="info">
   The list of parameters that composed an arke is named `Struct` (structure)
</Callout>

### Units

After the definition of our arke and their parameters, we can create an `unit`.
The unit is the specific instance of the arke. Always considering our arke `customer`, an `unit` is the
specific customer (eg. Company S.p.A.) with his data (name, email, phone number), defined previously by parameters.

### Link

Link is a special parameter that describes the relation/connection between units.
For our application the customer could be connected on a list of projects. We'll define a topology `link` that connect the
customer as `Parent` of a list of projects `Child`.

### Group

With Group you can create aggregation of arke and relative units. In our case we can create a `kpi` group that
groups all leads and projects. In this way we can have autogenerated APIs for this group with sorting, filtering `units` of all arke
in this group.

## Schema

Below you can find a complete rappresentation that can help you to understand the main actors and their scope.

<Callout type="info">
  Arke is the primitive that unlock the functionalities (such CRUD APIs, struct, sorting). Each
  upper layer shared that functionalities and extend them
