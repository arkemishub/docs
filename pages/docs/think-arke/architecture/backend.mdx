# Backend service
Arke Backend service is a robust and scalable backend service built on top of the Arke framework, designed to handle the server-side
logic, data management. This represent the Arke core and provides a comprehensive set of features for building backend
systems that power modern web applications, APIs, and microservices.

- Phoenix App: the backend core, is the server-side logic written on Elixir language and based on Phoenix web framework.
- Database: the persistance store, currently is a Postgres DB but in future other Database types are pluggable.

## Phoenix App
Phoenix App is a boilerplate initialized through Arke New template. With Arke new you can get a Phoenix application up
and running as quickly as possible.

Follow the [backend installation](/backend/installation) section to init it. Inside it we found a plug-and-play environment
equipped with arke hex packages.

This is our starter backend application customizable for our needs.
