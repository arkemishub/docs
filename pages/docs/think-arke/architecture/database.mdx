# Database
PostgreSQL on Arke combines the power and reliability of the PostgreSQL relational database management system with the
flexibility and scalability of the Arke framework, providing developers with a robust solution for storing, managing,
and querying data in their applications. It's a powerful open-source database known for its advanced features, SQL
compliance, and support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactions, making it an ideal
choice for a wide range of applications.

## PostgreSQL
Follow the [postgress installation](/backend/installation/postgres) section to init it.

When Arke application is initialized a set of seeds data are stored on Database to manage Arke application. This system
informations are stored on a special Schema named `Arke System`.

## Arke tables
Arke tables have a specific columns definition, on this section we'll discover our data are managed.

#### Arke Unit
The `arke_unit` table contains all stored units of your application. On Database view you can see that also parameter
are stored on this table, this is because also parameter are units.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ¤¯">
  Parameters are unit that use as arke_id the type of data. For example the `string` type is an Arke with pre-configured
  parameters
</Callout>


| Column name |                          Description                           |
|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
| id          | identifier - can be a recognizable key or autogenerated (UUID) |
| arke_id     |           arke identifier (arke if is the primitive)           |
| data        |     JSON format `parameters` list with value and datetime.     |
| metadata    |           JSON format additional system information            |
| inserted_at |              ISO Datetime string of unit creation              |
| updated_at  |               ISO Datetime string of unit update               |

#### Arke Link
The `arke_link` table contains all informations of links. On Database view you can see that also parameter are linked
with a parent/child relations with arke, this is created when we associate a parameter on one arke.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ¤¯">
  Parameters are child link of one arke
</Callout>


| Column name |                                                         Description                                                          |
|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| type        |                      type of connection could be parameter, group, permission relation or a custom link                      |
| parent_id   |                                                 `arke id` parent of relation                                                 |
| child_id    |                                                 `arke id` child of relation                                                  |
| metadata    | JSON format additional overridable system information, for example on permission we can see the methods permission defitions |
