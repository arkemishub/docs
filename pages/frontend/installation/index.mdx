# Installation
To start the frontend development there are System Requirements:
- [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/en) or later.

To start with frontend development we need to initialize the [Frontend Starter](/docs/think-arke/architecture/frontend#frontend-starter).

## CLI Installation
We recommend starting a new Arke Frontend app using `arkectl create-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you.
