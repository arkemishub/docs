This chapter will guide you step by step into the development of an app with Arke.
Our final goal is to create a simple app todo app.

## Prerequisites

- [arkectl](/guides/cli)

## Run locally and create a new project

1. Start the console and the API service and create a new project called `nextjs-todo`.

   ```bash
    arkectl init nextjs-todo
   ```
2. Create a new nextjs app by using arke templates
